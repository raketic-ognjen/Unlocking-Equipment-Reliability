# Unlocking Equipment Reliability: MTTR & MTBF Analytics for Failure Reduction

This project demonstrates how data-driven reliability engineering can significantly reduce equipment failures and optimize maintenance interventions. Using simulated downtime and failure logs, we analyze **Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)** and **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)** to uncover hidden patterns, chronic issues, and improvement opportunities.

## ðŸ”§ Key Objectives

- ðŸ“Š Quantify MTTR and MTBF for individual machines and system-wide performance
- ðŸ§  Identify high-impact failure modes using Pareto and Root Cause Analysis
- ðŸ§© Visualize trends through dashboards and failure timelines
- ðŸ”„ Use reliability metrics to inform proactive maintenance strategies
